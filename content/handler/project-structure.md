## What Your Project Folder Should Look Like

Before you continue with the Lambda setup, make sure your local project folder looks similar to the example below. This is the **minimal structure** you need to follow this tutorial successfully.

👉 **View the reference repo here:** *[cors-proxy-handler](https://github.com/cjp0421/cors-proxy-handler?tab=readme-ov-file)*

---

### 📁 Minimal Project Structure

Your folder should look like this:

```
/
├─ main.go               # Your actual Lambda handler (this is the one you deploy)
├─ build.sh              # Script that compiles the handler for Lambda and zips it
├─ go.mod                # Go module file (created with 'go mod init')
├─ go.sum                # Auto-generated dependency checksums (created by Go)
```

This is intentionally light. You do **not** need a large directory layout, extra packages, or complicated build tools. When your folder looks like the structure above, you’re ready to move on.

### 🧩 What Each File Does (Quick Summary)

#### `main.go`  
This is the handler you’ll deploy to AWS Lambda.  

#### `build.sh`  
A small script that builds your Go binary for AWS (Linux/amd64) and packages it into `function.zip` for upload.  

#### `go.mod`  
Go’s module file. It keeps track of your Lambda dependencies.

#### `go.sum`

Automatically generated by Go when you download dependencies. You never edit this file manually — it simply records checksums to ensure reproducible builds.

### 🎯 Why This Minimal Layout Matters

This tutorial focuses on learning the Lambda proxy pattern, not on managing a huge Go project.  
Keeping your repo small means:

- You can find everything easily  
- Nothing distracts from understanding the handler  
- It’s simple to build, test, and deploy   

### How to Create the Project Structure

If your folder doesn’t look like the minimal structure yet, here are the exact steps to create it from scratch.

#### 1. Create a new folder
```sh
mkdir cors-proxy
cd cors-proxy
```

#### 2. Initialize a Go module
```sh
go mod init cors-proxy
```

#### 3. Create your handler file
```sh
touch main.go
```
You will paste the Minimal Example handler into this file later.

#### 4. Create the build script
```sh
touch build.sh
chmod +x build.sh
```
👉 Click to see the **[Build Script](/appendix/build-script/)**.

#### 5. Add the AWS Lambda dependency
```sh
go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
```
This automatically generates `go.sum`.

---

#### Final folder structure
After completing the steps above, your folder should contain:

```
main.go
build.sh
go.mod
go.sum
```

You now have the structure required to continue with the tutorial.
